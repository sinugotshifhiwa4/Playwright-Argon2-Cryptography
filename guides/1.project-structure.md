- `eslint`

## Project Structure

### Configurations

#### `app-settings.ts`
This file contains essential configurations, including encoding settings and Winston logging configuration.

- **FileEncoding Enum**: Specifies supported file encoding types like `UTF8`, `BASE64`, `ASCII`, and `HEX`.
- **WinstonLoggerConfig Enum**: Defines logging configurations, such as time zone, date format, log levels, and log file paths.

#### `crypto-config.json`
Defines parameters for cryptographic operations, including key derivation settings and parameter lengths:
- `IV_LENGTH`, `SALT_LENGTH`, `SECRET_KEY_LENGTH`, and `HASH_LENGTH` for encryption.
- Key derivation properties like `TIME_COST` and `PARALLELISM`.

#### `constants-config.ts`
Holds constant parameters such as Argon2 memory cost and maximum log file size.  
All parameters are private and accessible only through `get` methods, ensuring encapsulation.

### Logging Setup
The project uses Winston for robust and scalable logging. The logging configuration includes log levels for `error`, `info`, `debug`, and `warn`. Each log level is configured to write to specific log files, using a level filter to ensure that logs are categorized without duplication. This setup reduces redundancy and keeps log management efficient.

### Centralized Error Handling
A centralized error-handling utility is used to standardize how errors are logged and handled throughout the project. The utility provides:
- **Log and Throw**: Logs the error and throws it for the caller to handle.
- **Log Only**: Logs the error without interrupting program flow.  
This modular approach ensures clear error reporting and aids in debugging.

### Utility Helper Class
The project includes a utility class for file management tasks. These tasks include:
- Reading and writing files.
- Checking if a file or directory exists.
- Ensuring that required directories or files are created if missing.
- Resolving file paths or directory paths dynamically.  
This modular utility improves code reuse and simplifies file handling across the project.

## Dependencies

- `playwright`: For browser automation.
- `argon2`: For password hashing and cryptography.
- `crypto-js`: For encryption and decryption tasks.
- `winston`: For logging with multiple log levels and file transports.
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.

# Project Structure Overview

This document provides an overview of the project structure, the implementation of encryption parameters, global environment configuration, and the core `CryptoUtil` class that handles cryptographic operations in the project.

## 1. Encryption Parameters

The `EncryptionParams` type is defined to structure the cryptographic parameters used for encryption and decryption processes.

```typescript
export type EncryptionParams = {
  salt: string;         // Salt used in key derivation or encryption
  iv: string;           // Initialization Vector for encryption
  cipherText: string;   // The encrypted data
  mac: string;          // Message Authentication Code for data integrity verification
};
```

```


This document provides a clear overview of the core cryptographic features, the setup for global configuration, and the utility class `CryptoUtil` that handles all the encryption and decryption operations in the project.

## Environment Configuration Setup for Playwright Tests

This document describes the environment configuration setup for running Playwright tests, ensuring that the environment variables are correctly loaded and accessible during test execution.

### Overview

The environment configuration is handled in several stages:

1. **Global Setup Loader** (`globalSetupLoader.ts`)
2. **Global Environment Configuration** (`globalEnvConfig.ts`)
3. **Playwright Configuration** (`playwright.config.ts`)
4. **Environment Variables Class** (`ENV.ts`)

Each of these steps ensures that environment variables are correctly loaded, validated, and accessible throughout the testing process.

---

### **1. Global Environment Configuration (`globalEnvConfig.ts`)**

The `GlobalEnvConfig` class is responsible for loading and setting up the environment configuration. This includes verifying that the required environment files exist, loading the base environment variables, and ensuring the correct environment is selected for the testing process.

#### Key Steps:

1. **Ensure Environment Directory Exists**:
   - Verifies that the environment directory exists where the configuration files are stored.

2. **Loading Base Environment File**:
   - The `.env` file is loaded using `dotenv` if it exists, and logs warnings if the file is not found.

3. **Load Environment-Specific Variables**:
   - Based on the `ENV` variable, the corresponding environment file (e.g., `.env.dev`, `.env.uat`) is loaded into the process.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Logs errors when loading environment variables and provides detailed information if an issue occurs.

### **2. Global Setup Loader (`globalSetUpLoader.ts`)**

The `globalSetupLoader.ts` file is the entry point for setting up the environment configuration. It calls `GlobalEnvConfig.initEnvConfiguration()` and handles any errors during the environment setup process.

#### Example:

```typescript
import GlobalEnvConfig from "./globalEnvConfig";
import ErrorHandler from "../helpers/errorHandler";

const errorHandler: ErrorHandler = new ErrorHandler();

async function globalSetupLoader(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await GlobalEnvConfig.initEnvConfiguration();
  } catch (error) {
    errorHandler.logError(error, "globalSetup", "Failed to set up environment variables");
    throw error;
  }
}

export default globalSetupLoader;
```

---

### **3. Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)**

In the Playwright configuration file, we specify the `globalSetup` entry point, which ensures that the environment is set up before running the tests.

#### Example:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 45 * 1000,
  expect: {
    timeout: 45 * 1000,
  },
  testDir: './tests',
  globalSetup: "./src/utils/globalSetUpLoader.ts",  // Path to the global setup loader
});
```

### **4. Environment Variables Class (`ENV.ts`)**

The `ENV` class defines all the necessary environment variables that are required by the portal, such as URLs, credentials, and secret keys.

#### Example:

```typescript
export default class ENV {
  // Portal environment variables

  public static PORTAL_URL = process.env.PORTAL_URL!;
  public static PORTAL_USERNAME = process.env.PORTAL_USERNAME!;
  public static PORTAL_PASSWORD = process.env.PORTAL_PASSWORD!;

  public static DEV_SECRET_KEY = process.env.DEV_SECRET_KEY!;
  public static UAT_SECRET_KEY = process.env.UAT_SECRET_KEY!;
}
```

These variables are retrieved from the `.env` file and can be used in the test scripts for accessing the necessary configurations.

---

### **Final Thoughts**

By following the above steps, you can ensure that your Playwright tests are properly configured and have access to the required environment variables for different environments. This setup ensures flexibility and smooth operation when running tests in different stages (development, UAT, production, etc.).

---

This project uses ESLint for linting. To set it up with TypeScript, create or update your `.eslintrc.js` file with the following configuration:

```javascript
import eslint from "@eslint/js";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";

export default tseslint.config(
  eslint.configs.recommended,
  ...tseslint.configs.recommended,
  {
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: true,
        tsconfigRootDir: ".",
      },
    },
    rules: {
      "@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises": "error",
      "@typescript-eslint/await-thenable": "error",
    },
  }
);
```

This configuration ensures TypeScript-specific linting rules are applied.

---

### **Scripts**

The following scripts are configured in `package.json` to help run tests and lint the code:

```json
"scripts": {
  "pretest:uat": "tsc --noEmit && eslint tests/**",
  "test:uat": "cross-env ENV=uat npx playwright test --project=chromium"
}
```

- **`pretest:uat`**: This script checks for TypeScript errors and runs ESLint on the `tests` folder.
- **`test:uat`**: This script runs the Playwright tests for the UAT environment using the Chromium browser.

---

### **Environment Setup Process**

1. **Ensure the Environment Directory**:
   - Ensure that the `envs/` directory exists and contains the necessary `.env` files for each environment (e.g., `envs/.env.dev`, `envs/.env.uat`).

2. **Set the `ENV` Variable**:
   - Set the `ENV` variable to specify which environment configuration to use. For example:
     ```bash
     export ENV=uat
     ```

3. **Run Playwright Tests**:
   - After setting the `ENV` variable, you can run the Playwright tests using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run test:uat
   ```

import * as cryptoConfig from "../config/crypto-config.json";
import { FileEncoding } from "../config/app.settings";
import ConstantsConfig from "../config/constantsConfig";
import ErrorHandler from "../helpers/errorHandler";
```

### Key Features of `CryptoUtil`

#### 3.1 Generate Secure Parameters

The `CryptoUtil` class provides methods to generate cryptographically secure initialization vectors (IVs), salts, secret keys, and message authentication codes (MAC).

- **Generate IV (Initialization Vector)**
  - `generateIvAsBase64`: Generates an IV as a base64 string.
  - `generateIvAsBuffer`: Generates an IV as a Buffer.

- **Generate Salt**
  - `generateSalt`: Generates a cryptographically secure salt in base64 format.

- **Generate Secret Key**
  - `generateSecretKey`: Generates a secure random key for encryption.

#### 3.2 Key Derivation Using Argon2

The class supports key derivation using Argon2, a modern password hashing algorithm, to securely derive keys from a secret key and salt.

```typescript
public static async deriveKeyWithArgon2(
  secretKey: string,
  salt: string
): Promise<CryptoJS.lib.WordArray> {
  const options = {
    type: argon2.argon2id,
    hashLength: cryptoConfig.PARAMETER_LENGTHS.HASH_LENGTH,
    salt: Buffer.from(salt, this.BASE_64),
    memoryCost: ConstantsConfig.getMemoryCost(),
    timeCost: cryptoConfig.KEY_DERIVATION.TIME_COST,
    parallelism: cryptoConfig.KEY_DERIVATION.PARALLELISM,
  };

  const derivedKey = await argon2.hash(secretKey, options);
  return CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(derivedKey);
}
```

#### 3.3 Encrypt and Decrypt Data

The `CryptoUtil` class provides methods for encrypting and decrypting data using AES, ensuring that the encryption is done securely with proper handling of IVs, keys, and cipher text.

- **Encrypt Data**

```typescript
public static encryptData(
  value: string,
  key: CryptoJS.lib.WordArray,
  iv: string
): string {
  try {
    const cipherText = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(value, key, {
      iv: CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(iv),
      mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
      padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7,
    }).toString();
    return cipherText;
  } catch (error) {
    this.errorHandler.logError(
      error,
      "encryptData",
      "Failed to encrypt text"
    );
    throw error;
  }
}
```

- **Decrypt Data**

```typescript
public static decryptData(
  decodedCipherText: CryptoJS.lib.WordArray,
  key: CryptoJS.lib.WordArray,
  decodedIv: CryptoJS.lib.WordArray
) {
  try {
    const decryptedBytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(
      { ciphertext: decodedCipherText } as CryptoJS.lib.CipherParams,
      key,
      { iv: decodedIv, mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7 }
    );
    return decryptedBytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
  } catch (error) {
    this.errorHandler.logError(
      error,
      "decryptData",
      "Failed to decrypt text"
    );
    throw error;
  }
}
```

#### 3.4 Message Authentication Code (MAC)

The class also provides a method for generating and verifying MACs using HMAC-SHA256 to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the encrypted data.

- **Generate MAC**

```typescript
public static generateMac(
  salt: string,
  iv: string,
  cipherText: string,
  key: CryptoJS.lib.WordArray
): string {
  try {
    return CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(
      `${salt}:${iv}:${cipherText}`,
      key.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64)
    ).toString();
  } catch (error) {
    this.errorHandler.logError(
      error,
      "generateMac",
      "Failed to generate MAC."
    );
    throw error;
  }
}
```

- **Verify MAC**

```typescript
public static verifyMac(computedMac: string, mac: string) {
  try {
    if (computedMac !== mac) {
      this.errorHandler.logThrowError(
        "MAC verification failed. The data may have been tampered with."
      );
    }
  } catch (error) {
    this.errorHandler.logError(error, "verifyMac", "Failed to verify MAC");
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

The `CryptoUtil` class uses the `ErrorHandler` class to log errors and handle exceptions during cryptographic operations.

```typescript
public static errorHandler: ErrorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
```

## 4. Conclusion

This implementation provides a comprehensive cryptographic utility for generating secure keys, encrypting and decrypting data, and ensuring the integrity of the data with MAC. The environment configuration and global setup classes make it easy to load and manage environment variables securely throughout the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Playwright installed in your project. If not, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install playwright
```

You will also need to install the Ortoni Report package:

```bash
npm install ortoni-report
```

## Playwright Configuration

### 1. Import Ortoni Report in Playwright Configuration

In your `playwright.config.ts` (or `playwright.config.js`), import the `OrtoniReportConfig` from the `ortoni-report` package:

```typescript
import { OrtoniReportConfig } from "ortoni-report";
```

### 2. Set Up Report Configuration

Create the configuration for Ortoni Report with your custom settings. You can customize the `folderPath`, `filename`, `authorName`, and other settings:

```typescript
const reportConfig: OrtoniReportConfig = {
  folderPath: "ortoni-report",  // Directory where the report will be saved
  filename: "ortoni-report.html",  // Name of the report file
  //logo: path.resolve(process.cwd(), ""),  // Add a logo if needed (optional)
  authorName: "Tshifhiwa Sinugo",  // Author name
  base64Image: false,  // Set to true if you want to embed images as base64
  preferredTheme: "dark",  // Choose 'dark' or 'light' theme for the report
  projectName: "Forge Argon2 Test Report",  // Project name
  testType: "Unit Test",  // Type of test (e.g., Unit Test, Integration Test)
};
```

### 3. Update Playwright Reporter Configuration

Under the `reporter` field in your Playwright configuration file, add the Ortoni Report alongside other reporters like HTML and JUnit:

```typescript
reporter: [
  ["html", { open: "never" }],  // HTML report (not auto-opened)
  ["junit", { outputFile: "results.xml" }],  // JUnit report (for CI tools)
  ["ortoni-report", reportConfig],  // Ortoni Report with custom config
  ["dot"],  // Dot reporter for test status in the terminal
],
```

### 4. View the Report

After running your tests with Playwright, Ortoni report will open automatically, as it setup in reporter.


This will open the HTML report generated in the `ortoni-report` folder.

## Additional Resources

For more information, you can visit the official Ortoni Report GitHub repository:

[Ortoni Report GitHub](https://github.com/ortoniKC/ortoni-report)

## Conclusion

With these steps, you should be able to integrate Playwright with Ortoni Report to generate detailed, customizable test reports.
